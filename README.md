# Capstone: Do It Better
My university capstone project.

This application was developed using Unity C# and the Microsoft Kinect Sensor skeletal tracking. 
- The aim of this project was to correct a users form/posture when executing the specific exercises inculded in the project scope. 
- I used the Unity co-ordinate mapping and Kinect sensor to track the X, Y, and Z co-ordinate positions of the user's skeletal joints to calculate and compare their movement joint-angles to the proper/standard joint angles for these specific movements.
